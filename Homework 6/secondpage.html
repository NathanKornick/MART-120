        <p>Agrestal</p>
            <p>During the day, Agrestal is a seemingly quiet and mundane town with gridded streets and neighborhoods. Houses align the shore of Lake Transpose which, much like the town itself, is calm and mild when the sun is floating in the sky. There is little activity out on its waters; no boats or people. Just the occasional meandering log being driven by the subtle current. You will likely see a seagull here and there but nothing more. The gravel streets are mostly desolate and absent of noise, except for the sounds of doors opening and closing in the mornings as citizens emerge from their modest homes to retrieve the daily newspaper. They catch up on the current events taking place outside of their comfy sanctuary with a hot cup of coffee, a tart glass of orange juice or a smooth glass of milk (whatever their choice of drink ends up being that day).</p>
            <p>I know what you’re thinking: Agrestal sounds like the kind of place that senior citizens in search of a quiet and tame locale would migrate to. However, I assure you, Agrestal is anything but tame. I haven’t told you what happens at night.</p>
            <p>When the sun goes down, Agrestal comes alive! Families emerge from their homes as the kids run around the streets while the parents light either a cigarette or a joint (whatever their choice of “lung dart” ends up being that day). Anyone who has a stereo turns up the volume and blasts their speakers. People fire up their grills and rip open and consume all the greasy, cholesterol-filled foods in their possession. In Agrestal, the liquor stores by far do their best business at night as costumers come storming through the doors, rushing to the aisles that house their drink of choice. Lake Transpose turns into a gigantic bath tub as hundreds of people flock to the water to swim, drink, and drive their boats to and fro. The calm waters of the day are shaken by the pandemonium of the night. Another fascinating detail about Agrestal is that the majority of the town’s repopulation and conception happens at night. The once reserved and insipid citizens of the day turn into wild and horny animals at night. </p>
            <p>You may be wondering “why?” Why does the transition from day to night have such a visceral effect on the people of Agrestal? Well, it’s because they spend the entire day tirelessly working from their homes. You see, there was a severe pandemic that hit the entire world hard and it’s still running ramped. Most jobs have their employees working remotely, and every school has their students learning online. People are still advised not to have contact with anyone, but because Agrestal is such a tight-knit community, people don’t mind being around each other. They take all that pent-up energy they’ve accumulated during the quarantine and unleash it at night. As someone who moved to Agrestal just a year ago right before the outbreak, I’ve learned that there is a lot of truth in the old adage “Don’t judge a book by its cover.” If Agrestal had a tagline, that would be it.</p>
